# Conversational Data Retrieval on Real Estate Database

## Project Overview
Developed an end-to-end conversational real estate database retrieval system using Streamlit UI, Google Palm LLM, and the Langchain framework. This system interacts with a MySQL database for dynamic Q&A, implementing few-shot learning and Hugging Face embeddings stored in ChromaDB for enhanced query accuracy.

## Introduction
This project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for querying real estate data conversationally. The system utilizes Google Palm LLM for natural language understanding, Langchain for managing the conversational flow, and integrates with a MySQL database. Few-shot learning and Hugging Face embeddings stored in ChromaDB are employed to improve query accuracy and relevance.
